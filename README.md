## What is SDD?

SDD (Skill-Driven Development) gives AI agents persistent context via `.agent/` files and stack skills.

## Repository structure

SDD goes beyond static context: it includes **agent roles** (planner, architect, builder, tester, reviewer, conductor) that form a structured development pipeline, **specification schemas** for traceable requirements, and **quality gates** (DoR/DoD) that prevent incomplete work from moving forward.

> Compatible with Claude, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Kiro, and any agent that reads markdown context files.

## Install

### Option 1: one-line install (curl)

```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/valossa515/sdd/main/scripts/install.sh) spring-boot
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/valossa515/sdd/main/scripts/install.sh) dotnet
```

### Option 2: install via `git clone` (recommended for teams)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/valossa515/sdd.git /tmp/sdd && \
  make -C /tmp/sdd install STACK=spring-boot TARGET=$(pwd)

# .NET
make -C /tmp/sdd install STACK=dotnet TARGET=$(pwd)
```

### Option 3: run from local clone

```bash
make install STACK=spring-boot TARGET=$(pwd)
# full flow: all checks + install
make bootstrap STACK=spring-boot TARGET=$(pwd)
```

This creates a `.agent/` folder in your project with all relevant skills, ready to customize.

**At task time**, the agent loads `.agent/SKILLS.md`, follows the links to the active skills, and generates code that respects:

- ✅ Your architecture (layered, Clean Arch, hexagonal)
- ✅ Your naming conventions
- ✅ Your testing patterns (JUnit 5, xUnit, Testcontainers)
- ✅ Your API design rules (REST, pagination, error format)
- ✅ Your database conventions (migrations, N+1 prevention, soft delete)
- ✅ Anti-invention guardrails (no hallucinated requirements)
- ✅ Quality gates (Definition of Ready / Definition of Done)

## Agent Pipeline

SDD includes six agent roles that form a structured development pipeline:

```
Requirement → planner → architect → builder → tester → reviewer
                              ↑ conductor orchestrates all ↑
```

| Role | File | Responsibility |
|------|------|----------------|
| **planner** | [agents/planner.md](agents/planner.md) | Convert requirement into feature spec + acceptance criteria |
| **architect** | [agents/architect.md](agents/architect.md) | Convert spec into architecture contract (layers, files, test strategy) |
| **builder** | [agents/builder.md](agents/builder.md) | Generate production code from contract or plan (`@implementation`) |
| **tester** | [agents/tester.md](agents/tester.md) | Design test strategy + generate tests (`@test-plan` + `@test`) |
| **reviewer** | [agents/reviewer.md](agents/reviewer.md) | Validate code against spec + contract + DoD (`@review`) |
| **conductor** | [agents/conductor.md](agents/conductor.md) | Orchestrate the full pipeline with confirmation gates |

Use the full pipeline for new features, or shortcut for simpler tasks:

| Task | Pipeline |
|------|----------|
| New feature | planner → architect → builder → tester → reviewer |
| Bugfix (clear spec) | architect → builder → tester → reviewer |
| Simple bugfix | builder → tester → reviewer |
| Refactor | builder → tester → reviewer |

See [agents/README.md](agents/README.md) for full documentation.

### Using agents in GitHub Copilot (VS Code)

When you install SDD, the script automatically creates `.github/agents/*.agent.md` files in your project. These are **custom agents** recognized natively by GitHub Copilot in VS Code.

After installation:

1. Open the Copilot Chat panel
2. Click the **agent dropdown** (where it says "Agent", "Ask", or "Plan")
3. You will see the SDD agents listed: **conductor**, **planner**, **architect**, **builder**, **tester**, **reviewer**
4. Select an agent and start chatting — it will follow its role instructions automatically

> **Tip:** If agents don't appear, reload the VS Code window (`Cmd+Shift+P` → `Developer: Reload Window`).

Each agent file includes the full role instructions plus a directive to read `.agent/SKILLS.md` before every task, so your project conventions are always respected.

## Specification Schemas

Specs create a traceability chain from requirement to code:

```
requirement → feature.spec.toon → acceptance.toon → contract.toon → code
```

| Schema | Purpose | Created by |
|--------|---------|------------|
| [feature.schema.md](specs/feature.schema.md) | Business behavior (inputs, outputs, business rules) | planner |
| [acceptance.schema.md](specs/acceptance.schema.md) | Given/When/Then testable criteria | planner |
| [contract.schema.md](specs/contract.schema.md) | Files, layers, dependencies, test strategy | architect |

See [specs/README.md](specs/README.md) for full documentation.

---

## Action Prompts

Step-by-step generation guides for common artifacts:

| Prompt | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [endpoint.md](prompts/endpoint.md) | Generate REST endpoint (controller + DTOs) |
| [entity.md](prompts/entity.md) | Generate domain entity with invariants |
| [service.md](prompts/service.md) | Generate application service / use case |
| [repository-impl.md](prompts/repository-impl.md) | Generate repository implementation |
| [test-suite.md](prompts/test-suite.md) | Generate test suite from test strategy |

See [prompts/README.md](prompts/README.md) for full documentation.

---

## Commands

```bash
make validate       # validates frontmatter + required context templates
make validate-specs # validates TOON spec files against the schemas
make install        # installs .agent/ for chosen stack
make bootstrap      # all checks + install in one flow
make update         # pull latest skills
make upgrade        # update + install (update SDD in an existing project)
make check          # validate + validate-specs + validate-agents
```

## Updating SDD

When a new version of SDD is released, you can update your project's `.agent/` folder in two ways:

### Option 1: upgrade from cloned repo (recommended)

If you cloned the SDD repo during initial install:

```bash
cd /path/to/sdd
git pull                # fetch latest version
make upgrade STACK=spring-boot TARGET=/path/to/your/project
```

`make upgrade` runs `update` (git pull) then `install` — replacing all skill, agent, prompt, and spec files in your project's `.agent/` folder while preserving your `SKILLS.md` overrides.

### Option 2: one-line reinstall (curl)

Re-run the install command to overwrite with the latest version:

```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/valossa515/sdd/main/scripts/install.sh) spring-boot /path/to/your/project
```

### Option 3: manual update

```bash
cd /path/to/sdd
git pull
make install STACK=spring-boot TARGET=/path/to/your/project
```

### What gets updated

| Artifact | Updated? | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| `skills/shared/*` | ✅ Yes | Guardrails, DoR, DoD, etc. |
| `skills/<stack>/*` | ✅ Yes | Stack-specific skills |
| `agents/*` | ✅ Yes | Agent role definitions |
| `prompts/*` | ✅ Yes | Action prompt templates |
| `specs/*` | ✅ Yes | Specification schemas |
| `SKILLS.md` | ✅ Yes | Regenerated from template |
| `.github/agents/*` | ✅ Yes | Copilot custom agents (auto-generated) |
| Your project overrides in `SKILLS.md` | ⚠️ Overwritten | Back up before updating |

> **Tip:** Before upgrading, commit your current `.agent/` folder so you can diff the changes and restore any custom overrides.

## How to use

After installation, your project will have `.agent/SKILLS.md`, agent definitions, and stack/shared skills.

### 1) Agent-driven workflow (recommended)

Use the agents directly — each one reads `.agent/SKILLS.md` automatically:

```text
# Full pipeline (new feature):
Act as the conductor defined in .agent/agents/conductor.md
Implement: order creation with validation and stock check

# Or invoke agents individually:
@planning
Plan the feature: user registration with email verification

@implementation
Execute the plan in .agent/plans/user-registration.md

@test
Write tests for the Order module following the testing skill.

@review
Review the changes in the current branch against main.

@refactor
Refactor the Order module to follow SKILL.md layer separation.
```

### 2) Direct skill references (supplementary)

You can also reference skills directly for targeted tasks:

```text
Read .agent/SKILLS.md.
Create endpoint POST /api/v1/orders following skills/shared/api-design.md,
use validation and RFC 7807 errors.
```

```text
Read .agent/SKILLS.md.
Refactor Order module to respect skills/spring-boot/SKILL.md
and skills/shared/database.md conventions.
```

### 3) Keep project-specific rules in `.agent/SKILLS.md`

In **Project Overrides**, add concrete rules such as:

- package/solution naming
- auth strategy
- migration paths
- non-functional constraints (timeouts, observability, etc.)

## How to use bootstrap (`@bootstrap`)

The shared `bootstrap` skill helps create/update project context docs in `.agent/`:

- `context.md`
- `architecture.md`
- `decisions.md` (or `adr/`)
- `conventions.md`
- `runbook.md`
- `glossary.md`
- `backlog_rules.md`

### Prompt-driven bootstrap

Use in prompt:

```text
@bootstrap
Read .agent/SKILLS.md, map the repository context, and update all .agent context files.
Do not invent facts: add TODOs for unknowns.
```

### CLI bootstrap (recommended)

```bash
make bootstrap STACK=spring-boot TARGET=$(pwd)
# or
make bootstrap STACK=dotnet TARGET=$(pwd)
```

This guarantees validation and generation happen before installation.

### Suggested bootstrap routine per project

1. Run `make bootstrap STACK=<stack> TARGET=$(pwd)`.
2. Open `.agent/context.md` and fill domain/problem details.
3. Register key architectural choices in `.agent/decisions.md` or `.agent/adr/`.
4. Update `.agent/glossary.md` with domain terminology.
5. Commit `.agent/` together with code changes.

## Invocable commands

SDD includes 6 invocable workflow commands. Each is handled directly by its corresponding agent role:

### Feature flow: `@planning` → `@implementation`

| Command | Agent / Skill | Purpose |
|---------|---------------|----------|
| `@planning` | → **planner** agent | Design a feature — produces plan.md + .spec.toon + .acceptance.toon |
| `@implementation` | → **builder** agent | Execute a plan — implements tasks in order following conventions |

```text
@planning
Plan the feature: user registration with email verification

# After plan review:
@implementation
Execute the plan in .agent/plans/user-registration.md
```

### Test flow: `@test-plan` → `@test`

| Command | Agent / Skill | Purpose |
|---------|---------------|----------|
| `@test-plan` | → **tester** agent | Design testing strategy + produce test plan document |
| `@test` | → **tester** agent | Write all tests from the plan — unit, integration, edge cases |

```text
@test-plan
Plan tests for the Order module

# The tester agent handles both planning and writing:
@test
Write tests for the Order module following the testing skill.
```

### Independent skills: `@review` and `@refactor`

| Command | Agent / Skill | Purpose |
|---------|---------------|----------|
| `@review` | → **reviewer** agent | Structured code review with 🔴🟡🔵 severity classification |
| `@refactor` | [refactor.md](skills/shared/refactor.md) | Restructure code to align with conventions without changing behavior |

```text
@review
Review the changes in the current branch against main.

@refactor
Refactor the Order module to follow skills/spring-boot/SKILL.md layer separation.
```

## Frontmatter required in all skills

Every skill markdown must include:

- `name`
- `description`
- `stack`
- `versions`

## ADR and glossary

Document architecture decisions in `decisions.md` (or `.agent/adr/adr-xxxx.md`) and keep domain terms in `glossary.md`.


## Troubleshooting: PR merge/diff issues

If a PR was merged with conflicts and your branch did not receive the README updates:

1. Confirm the latest commit contains README changes:
   - `git log --oneline -n 5`
   - `git show --name-only <commit_sha>`
2. Rebase your branch on the target branch (`main` or release branch).
3. If needed, cherry-pick the README commit:
   - `git cherry-pick <commit_sha>`
4. Re-run checks:
   - `make check`
5. Open README and confirm sections:
   - "How to use skills in your project"
   - "How to use bootstrap (`@bootstrap`)"

This helps guarantee onboarding docs are present after merge.
